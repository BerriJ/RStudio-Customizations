## Using "Dark" RStudio

To use this theme, you'll need to do the following things:

### MacOS

First, go to `~/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/www/` and paste `custom_styles.css`  and `index.htm` in that directory and allow the replacement of the old `index.htm`.

### Linux

First, go to `~/usr/lib/rstudio/www/` on Linux and paste `custom_styles.css`  and `index.htm` in that directory and allow the replacement of the old `index.htm`.

### Windows

This should also work on windows. I'm not a windows person so please let me know if you figures out where to place the 2 files on windows.
